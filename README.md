# Bayesian-Inference

In this repository I will upload materials regarding the course "Bayesian Inference" held by Prof. D.Cocchi in the University of Bologna. 

## Books
In the "Books" section you will find 3 books: 
- "A first course in Bayesian inference" is the book suggested during the course, it is consistent with the notation helded in class and it's highly reccomended;
- "A student's guide to Bayesian statistics" is the most simplest book that I founded online, it is very simple and effective, although the level of the course requires a bit more mathematics. Very reccomended when struggling with a concecpt to get the basics of it
- "Bayesian Data Analysis" is a more complex book but very broad, almost every topic is well covered in any details.
In my personal study I followed a mix of them: I hope to stay consistent with the notation and with the stream of thoughts in my personal notes if you are going to use them.
